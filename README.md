The website is going to have at least 4 webpages which are:
  -page1(visual page)  - Home  - Blog  - About - Contact - Copyright

- page1: first ever page the user sees. It will have an image and a welcome message
CHANGED TO HOME BECAUSE IT MADE NO SENSE.

- Home: A small intro to the content of the website and what to expect and find

- Blog: Links to different content and topics. More work will be done in this section as it should organise the topics. So it goes from displaying the topic to the content title and description to the actual blog post.
Topic -- Titles -- Blog post

- About: Area where developer gets to explain their project/work

- Contact: The usual stuff: Name, linkedIn (optional), email address, country(never personal address)

- Copyright: Explaining the legal stuff about copyrighting the website.
